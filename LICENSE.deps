  A few of the files needed to use the GNU-style build procedure come with
  slightly different licenses, though they are all similar in spirit.  A few

  at the notice in config.guess or ltmain.sh.)

  PCRE is a library of functions to support regular expressions whose syntax
  and semantics are as close as possible to those of the Perl 5 language.
  
  This is JavaScriptCore's variant of the PCRE library. While this library
  started out as a copy of PCRE, many of the features of PCRE have been
  removed.

deps/libatomic_ops:

  Our intent is to make it easy to use libatomic_ops, in
  both free and proprietary software.  Hence most code that we expect to be
  linked into a client application is covered by an MIT-style license.
  
  A few library routines are covered by the GNU General Public License.
  These are put into a separate library, libatomic_ops_gpl.a .
  
  The low-level part of the library is mostly covered by the following
  license:
  
  ----------------------------------------
  
  Copyright (c) ...
  
  Permission is hereby granted, free of charge, to any person obtaining a copy
  of this software and associated documentation files (the "Software"), to deal

  copies of the Software, and to permit persons to whom the Software is

  The above copyright notice and this permission notice shall be included in all

  AUTHORS OR COPYRIGHT HOLDERS BE LIABLE FOR ANY CLAIM, DAMAGES OR OTHER
  LIABILITY, WHETHER IN AN ACTION OF CONTRACT, TORT OR OTHERWISE, ARISING FROM,
  OUT OF OR IN CONNECTION WITH THE SOFTWARE OR THE USE OR OTHER DEALINGS IN THE
  SOFTWARE.
  
  --------------------------------
  
  A few files in the sysdeps directory were inherited in part from the
  Boehm-Demers-Weiser conservative garbage collector, and are covered by
  its license, which is similar in spirit:
  
  --------------------------------
  
  Copyright (c) ...
  
  THIS MATERIAL IS PROVIDED AS IS, WITH ABSOLUTELY NO WARRANTY EXPRESSED
  OR IMPLIED.  ANY USE IS AT YOUR OWN RISK.
  
  Permission is hereby granted to use or copy this program
  for any purpose,  provided the above notices are retained on all copies.
  Permission to modify the code and to distribute modified code is granted,
  provided the above notices are retained, and a notice that the code was
  modified is included with the above copyright notice.
  
  ----------------------------------
  
  A few files are covered by the GNU General Public License.  (See file
  "COPYING".) This applies only to test code, sample applications,
  and the libatomic_ops_gpl portion of the library.
  Thus libatomic_ops_gpl should generally not be linked into proprietary code.
  (This distinction was motivated by patent considerations.)
  
  It is possible that the license of the GPL pieces may be changed for
  future versions to make them more consistent with the rest of the package.
  If you submit patches, and have strong preferences about licensing, please
  express them.
